## OSGi

- Specifies a component and service model for Java
- Components (bundles) can be installed, started, stopped, and uninstalled at runtime
- Each bundle gets its own classloader
- Bundles define dependencies and export some of their packages (unlike a JAR)
- Similar goals as Java 9 modularization
- Several OSGi implementations, Eclipse's is Equinox
- GlassFish, JBoss, WebSphere, IntelliJ, and many others are all based on OSGi
### Services
- OSGi also offers services to connect bundles
- Service is a POJO and can be registered at a Service Registry at bundle start
- For historical reasons, Eclipse does not use OSGi services but Extensions and Extension Points

### Extension Points
